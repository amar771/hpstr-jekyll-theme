# Me?

I'm an InfoSec enthusiast who likes to automate everything.
In love with Linux and Open-Source.

My main languages of development and Python3 and Crystal-lang and I'm currently running Ubuntu as my main distro.

I also like to draw but I'm really bad at it.

## Work

Currently working as Head of AppSec Research team at NeuraLegion. Researching and automating application security vulnerabilities, also leading a team of DevSec engineers to do the same.
